# Day 4

More notes for myself.

Are the solutions pretty? No, but I wanted to solve these without for loops to check
for win conditions, and to try and do the whole thing event-driven to try and keep the big-O down.

I feel like I accomplished this, as the only for loops in the solutions are required to initialize things, and "call" each bingo number.
